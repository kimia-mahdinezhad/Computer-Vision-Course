# Fundamentals of Computer Vision Course Repository

This GitHub repository has been created as a dedicated platform for the "Fundamentals of Computer Vision" course, which was successfully completed as part of my university program. The repository encompasses comprehensive information and resources pertaining to the course, including documentation, assignments, and relevant codes. The following is an overview of the course topics covered:

## Course Topics

1. **Basics**: This section delves into the foundational principles and concepts essential for a thorough understanding of computer vision.

2. **Spatial**: Explore the spatial domain and its significance in image processing and computer vision.

3. **Frequency**: Gain insights into the frequency domain and its application in analyzing visual data.

4. **Wavelet**: Study the wavelet transform and its role in image processing and feature extraction.

5. **Color**: Understand the intricacies of color in computer vision and its importance in various applications.

6. **Morphology**: Learn about morphological operations and their utility in image processing and analysis.

7. **Features**: Explore techniques for detecting and describing image features, a critical aspect of computer vision.

8. **SIFT/SURF**: Delve into the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithms, which are commonly used for feature extraction.

9. **Bag of Features**: Understand the concept of the "bag of features" model and its relevance in computer vision tasks.

10. **Optical Flow**: Gain knowledge of optical flow analysis and its application in tracking object motion in images and videos.
